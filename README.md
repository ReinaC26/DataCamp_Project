# DataCamp_Project
**Predictive Modeling for Agriculture**: A machine learning project in Python to predict crop types based on soil composition. The project involves data preprocessing, multi-class logistic regression training, and an iterative feature evaluation loop to determine which soil characteristic provides the highest predictive power based on F1-score metrics.
